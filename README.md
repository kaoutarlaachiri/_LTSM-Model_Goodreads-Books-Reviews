# _LTSM-Model_Goodreads-Books-Reviews
## Description
In this project, We used the Kaggle GoodReads dataset to train an LSTM model that can predict the rating of a book review. The model was trained using Python  for building the LSTM model. I then built a web service using FastAPI, web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. I also built an interface using Angular, an open-source web application framework, to make it user-friendly to interact with the API.

## This repository consists of three branches 
* main : contains the notebook for preprocessing dataset and training the ltsm model
* front : contains code for front-end of the application
* back-end : contains the fast-api


--------------- 
For the fast-api you need to download the saved_model folder from this link :
